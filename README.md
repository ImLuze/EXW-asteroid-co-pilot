# Asteroid Co-Pilot
Imagine you are the co-pilot of a spaceship surrounded by hundreds of asteroids... a very frustrated co-pilot...
The ship's only weapon against the incoming rain of flying space rocks is a single laser gun. Except you haven't got any control over it, or the tiny ship for that matter. You are only the co-pilot after all...

## Controls
Lead your ship to safety by shouting commands at your captain, the more frustrated and loudly you shout, the more heavily your captain will react.

Shouting:
TURN - Will turn the ship.
FIRE - Will fire the ship's laster gun.
GO - Will move the ship forward.
